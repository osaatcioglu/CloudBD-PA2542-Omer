This sprint was a good practice to see how to use Vagrant directly with Digital Ocean. I had used Digital Ocean with micro services before. But, this was the first time that I used Vagrant directly to control the drops. 

This gives a lot of possibilities to play with in the development and production environment. We can deploy a new instance for testing, staging and even production and then switch the load balancer to serve the new instance. 

I also learned more how to create puppet classes in different files and use them in the main puppet executer.
