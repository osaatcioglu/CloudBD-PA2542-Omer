I had already Virtualbox and vagrant installed on my system.

I downloaded vagrant image hashicorp/precise64 and played a bit with the Ubuntu instance.

Before Vagrant, I was using Virtualbox to create and run the virtual machine and I was setting up the ssh public key and such to make sure that I can login to the machine without a password. Moreover; I had to install guest additions and create a share folder to be able to share files between OSes. Vagrant simplifies all these processes out of the box.  

The default *Vagrantfile* is created.
